# Online Quiz Management System

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Online Quiz Management System** is a Java-based web application developed as part of the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** course project.
It allows administrators to create and manage quizzes, while students can take quizzes online and receive instant results.
The system follows **OOP principles** and is built using **Java & Spring Boot** for scalability and maintainability.
